Hi Sumanth,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to inform you that I'm not feeling well today, so I would like to request rescheduling my interview to the second half of the day or possibly tomorrow, if that's convenient for you.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Husain
