To update the MSBuild version in Jenkins, you need to install the updated version of MSBuild on your system and then configure Jenkins to use it. Here are the steps:
1.	Install the updated version of MSBuild: You can download the latest version of MSBuild from the official Microsoft website. If you have Visual Studio installed, you can also update Visual Studio to get the latest version of MSBuild.
2.	Configure Jenkins to use the updated version of MSBuild:
•	Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Global Tool Configuration".
•	Under the "MSBuild" section, click on "MSBuild installations".
•	If you already have an MSBuild configured, you can update the "Path to MSBuild" to point to the new version. The path typically looks like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe. Replace 2019\Community with your Visual Studio version and edition.
•	If you don't have an MSBuild configured, you can click on "Add MSBuild" and then provide a name and the path to the MSBuild executable.
•	Click on "Apply" and then "Save".
Now, Jenkins should use the updated version of MSBuild for building your projects.
